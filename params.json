{"name":"AndroidSensorSupport","tagline":"A model for sensors and sensors data in Android","body":"AndroidSensorSupport provides a model for sensors and sensor data that makes easier sensors request and data usage in Android applications.\r\n\r\nThe model has been developed as project activity related to the <a href=\"http://www-natali.deis.unibo.it\">Engineering of Software Systems</a> course at University of Bologna.\r\n\r\nThe useful features that this model introduces are: \r\n* the new sensor classes are not only observer of the real sensor but also observable\r\n* the onSensorChange() method updates transparently the SensorData and notifies this update to all observers\r\n* is also introduced a SensorData model that contains all sensor data informations relative to the last update and provide a JSON and a Prolog representation\r\n* is defined an AndroidSensorFactory that returns a specific sensor and provides to registrate the Android Sensor to the SensorManager\r\n* is defined an SensorDataUtils class that rebuild the SensorData from a JSON string representation\r\n\r\nLast update: 2014/07/30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more informations, proposals, extensions, corrections and, obviously, bug please contact me: <a href=\"mailto://carlo.antenucci@gmail.com\">carlo.antenucci[at]gmail.com</a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
